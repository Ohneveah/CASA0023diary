## 8.1 Summary

### Synthetic Aperture Radar(SAR)

-   Active sensors

-   Have surface texture data

-   See through weather and clouds

-   Different wavelengths - different applications

**How SAR works**

1.  Emits electromagnetic signals and records the reflected signals (backscatter).
2.  Transforms the phase of the signal as the radar moves to achieve high-resolution imaging.
3.  Multiple images are synthesized into a "synthetic" aperture to improve image quality.

**SAR polarization**

-   Rough scattering (e.g. bare earth) = most sensitive to VV

-   Volume scattering (e.g. leaves) = cross, VH or HV

-   Double bounce (e.g. trees / buildings) = most sensitive to HH.

    Notes: The first "H" or "V" of the polarization letter refers to the polarization of the transmitted signal, while the second refers to the polarization of the received signal.

A SAR signal has both **amplitude** (backscatter) and **phase** data.

**Backscatter (amplitude)**

-   Polarization

    -   VV = surface roughness

    -   VH = volume of surface

-   Permativity (dielectric constant) - how **reflective** is the property (**reflective back to the sensor).**

-   The return **value**, remember the band (wavelength)

-   Phase: Location in the cycle after return

**InSAR**: Reveals surface topography by comparing phase differences in two or more SAR images.

**DInSAR**: Identifies surface deformation between observations by comparing phase differences in two SAR images in combination with external topographic data (e.g., Digital Elevation Model, DEM).

**In GEE, only the amplitude (backscatter).**

**SAR data values**

-   power scale (RAW data) = analysis

-   amplitude scale = visualisation

-   dB scale (in GEE) = dark pixel differences

**Identifying change**

-   Subtract images

-   (Original) ratio images

-   Improved ratio (IR)

-   Mean ratio images

-   Log ratio images

-   Improved ratio log ratio image

**The variance over time through:**

-   T-test

-   Standard deviation

**Fusing SAR data to optical data**

-   Principal component analysis

-   Object based image analysis

-   Intensity fusion

## 8.2 Application

This section looks at related applications of SAR.

Bayındır et al. (2017) explored the use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images and change detection algorithms to monitor oil spills. The study compares two algorithms: the correlation coefficient change statistic and the intensity ratio change statistic, and introduces a new method to improve detection accuracy by accumulating changes in time series images. In a case study of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the intensity-ratio change statistic shows better oil spill detection results, and the new method effectively reduces the false alarm rate and improves the reliability of oil spill detection.

However, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image ship detection systems are challenged by adversarial attacks that mislead the model by adding subtle disturbances to the input samples, leading to false outputs with high confidence. In order to improve the stability and security of the system, attack algorithms need to be investigated to enhance the model's generalization and defense capabilities.Gao et al. (2023) proposed an attack algorithm based on Gaussian noise attributes, which not only significantly affects the accuracy of the SAR ship detection model, but also improves the model's resistance to attacks and generalization during defense training. By filtering the attack data, the defense performance of the model can be effectively improved.

## 8.3 Reflection

I found it very interesting to learn about the principles of SAR in this class, and I was shocked to know that remote sensing technology nowadays can actually monitor the small deformation of the earth's surface through SAR images acquired at different times. Since SAR involves complex principles and algorithms, systematic learning is still difficult and challenging for me to establish a complete knowledge system. If I overcome these challenges, I can not only improve my professional skills, but also enhance my problem-solving ability and self-confidence. My friend recommended me a book recommended "Synthetic Aperture Radar Imaging Algorithms and Implementations" difficult, but able to in-depth understanding and some more detailed theoretical support. Before I read this book, combing and summarizing the basics such as linear FM signals, high azimuthal resolution principles, etc., in order to build a framework for SAR technology, laying the cornerstone for my understanding of more advanced concepts. Moreover, I was amazed to see a TV news story earlier where SAR technology revealed ancient ruins hidden beneath the surface. As the technology advances, I expect that SAR will lead to more innovative and interesting applications in the future.
